      "Visiting the Taj Mahal was an incredible experience! The moment I stepped onto the premises, I was mesmerized by its grandeur and beauty. The intricate marble work, the stunning symmetry, and the sheer magnificence of this wonder left me in awe. The gardens were well-maintained, and the view of the monument reflecting in the water was breathtaking.\n\nI visited on a weekday, so the crowd was manageable. The entry process was smooth, and the wait time was around 10-30 minutes. Security checks were thorough, but the staff was helpful and efficient.\n\nInside, the details of the craftsmanship were mind-blowing. The inlaid gemstone work and calligraphy on the walls added to its charm. It‚Äôs a place that truly embodies history, love, and architectural brilliance.\n\nIf you're planning a visit, I recommend arriving early in the morning to enjoy the serene beauty before the crowd builds up. Also, hiring a guide can enhance the experience, as they share fascinating historical facts. Overall, an unforgettable trip and a must-visit destination!",
      "Considered more than a world wonder, this monument has a genuine Aura on its own.  There's mysterious stillness in this place combined with the air of awesomeness. Besides the architectural beauty, this monument stands for the greatness of love, artistry & skills of all those involved centuries ago. You can't have enough of it despite viewing the monument from all over the sides. It continues to haunt you forever !",

It is incredible experience there very nice place to go there with family.\nVery beautiful üíó, a place to visit once in your life.\nVery beautiful painting on the walls, The walls made with white marble, red sandstone, and semi-precious stones.",
      "What to say about an amazing sight, it did not disappoint.\n\nThings be aware of. You will wait in a line to get in for security reasons. Security in India is a big show and VERY inefficient but be prepared to be crammed and touched by strangers.\n\nIf you get a guide, and you should, ask them to help and they‚Äôll likely just drag you to the front of the queue anyway.\n\nEnjoy the sites, take your time. They say it‚Äôs a 3 hour maximum time but no one is checking.\n\nLook from every angle, they‚Äôre unique.\n\nAlso, expect a million people, you‚Äôre not going to get a quiet photo.",
      "The Taj Mahal is truly beautiful! The white marble looks amazing, especially in the morning and evening. The place is big, peaceful, and full of history. Walking around the gardens and seeing the reflection in the water is a wonderful experience. It‚Äôs a must-visit if you love history and beautiful places!",
      "That sounds exciting! Visiting the Taj Mahal is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The breathtaking beauty and intricate architecture of this iconic monument will leave you in awe.

      "A place to visit once in your life. No words for it. There‚Äôs a reason its part of the 7 wonders of the world.Amazing stone work building made over 400 years ago by 20,000 people taking 22 years. It is well worth getting a guide if you want to learn the history.\n\n* 2 or 3 hrs needed to have a good look and walk around it.\n*Normal ticket price is 45/- per person for general entry. And 200/- to see the mausoleum.\n* There is a buggy service also costing 60/- per peeson. You can buy ticket online also in advance.\n* There are 2 slots available forenoon and afternoon. You can select any one as per your choice.\n*Do not plan visits on Fridays.

      "Standing in front of the Taj Mahal, I finally understood why it‚Äôs called the symbol of love. The sheer beauty, the symmetry, and the detailed craftsmanship are breathtaking. The moment the sun rises, the white marble glows with golden hues, creating a magical aura. It‚Äôs an experience beyond words! If you visit Agra, this is a must-see masterpiece of history and romance. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI have visited for 2 Days."

    "place": "Hawa Mahal, India",
    "reviews": [
      "The Hawa Mahal, an iconic architectural masterpiece in Jaipur, is a must-visit on your trip to the Pink City. This stunning monument, built from red and pink sandstone, is also known as the Palace of Winds. The building's majestic facade along the main road catches everyone's eye.\n\nOne downside is its location on a busy street, which can make evenings quite chaotic and challenging for photography due to the heavy crowds. However, this bustling atmosphere adds to the charm, making every moment enjoyable.\n\nDon't forget to explore the nearby shops, though be prepared to flex your bargaining skills as prices can be quite high.",
      "Absolutely stunning. A must visit when in Jaipur. And you must visit Jaipur to see this historic beauty. Make sure you take a guide to understand the history of the place. Go in the afternoon so that you can see the sunset from here which is a magnificent sight for your eyes. I can't stop gushing about this place enough. So go and experience yourself. Strongly Recommended!! üëçüèª",
      "Stunning Architectural Marvel: Hawa Mahal is a testament to Jaipur's rich history and architectural brilliance. The intricate latticework, the countless windows, and the pink sandstone facade make it a visual delight. It's a place where history meets art, and its unique design offers a glimpse into the regal past of Rajasthan.\n\nCharming Ambience: The ambience is mesmerizing, especially during early mornings or late afternoons when the sunlight casts enchanting patterns through the windows. The structure exudes a sense of serenity and grandeur, making it a perfect spot for photography enthusiasts and history buffs.\n\nCleanliness Well-Maintained: The cleanliness of the premises is commendable, with efforts evident in keeping the site neat despite the high footfall of tourists. However, the narrow corridors and staircases could benefit from regular upkeep to ensure they remain tidy throughout the day.\n\nMaintenance Could Be Improved: While the overall experience is wonderful, some areas of the Mahal show signs of wear and tear. Cracked walls and faded paint need immediate attention to preserve the beauty of this iconic landmark. Improved signage and lighting within the structure would also enhance the visitor experience.\n\nConvenient Online Ticketing: Booking tickets online is a hassle-free process, saving visitors time and avoiding long queues. This modern convenience makes the visit much more enjoyable, allowing tourists to focus on exploring the majestic monument without unnecessary delays.\n\nOverall: Hawa Mahal is a must-visit for anyone exploring Jaipur, offering a blend of beauty, history, and culture. With slight improvements in maintenance, it could become an even more unforgettable experience.",
      "One of the most beautiful places to be seen in Jaipur. Located near the famous City Palace. The palace claims to be having more than 950 windows.  Its design is quite intricate and having honey comb pattern. The purpose is obviously having light breeze moving around to keep the atmosphere within cool. The monument is 5 storied structure and the top floors are accessible through ramp.  The sandstone used in the construction lends its colour to the monument. On the eastern facade we have the world famous view but since a major road passes along, it is quite difficult to enjoy it for a longer time. The view is more beautiful in the night. The lights going up .. it simply enhances the beauty. Tourists need to watch for timings of visit. Enjoy the narrow passages, light entering at intervals providing a nice background for photography. The fountain within adds to the beauty. Well maintained, neat and clean. .. Towards the end a miniature model of the monument can be seen to understand the grand design...a must visiting for tourists",
      "Landmark Historic Monument of Pink City Jaipur. Lot have been written about it. It‚Äôs one of the most photographed building. Everyone has seen it from front but today went to see it from inside. The ticket costs ‚Çπ52 per person. One can go right up to the top. Lovely view of old city from the top. Worth a visit.",
      "Hawa Mahal ‚Äì A Beautiful Architectural Wonder!\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏éVisited on a Sunday ‚Äì quite crowded.\n‚ñ™Ô∏éStunning architecture with intricate windows and rich history.\n‚ñ™Ô∏éEntry ticket for Indians: ‚Çπ52\n‚ñ™Ô∏éAmazing view from the top, offering a glimpse of Jaipur‚Äôs charm.\n‚ñ™Ô∏éA must-visit for history buffs and photography lovers!",
      "Jaipur‚Äôs Hawa Mahal, made of red and pink sandstone, is a breathtaking masterpiece of local artistry. From the top of the palace, you can enjoy a panoramic view of the city. And at night, the lights on the architecture create a magical ambiance that‚Äôs simply awe-inspiring. If you‚Äôre looking for a different perspective, there are two cafes opposite Hawa Mahal where you can watch the beauty of the palace bathed in the night lights .",
      "We visited in evening to see the lighting view. Cazy mad rush. First time ever Jaipur Metro had so much rush that it was uncontrollable by the security. Recommended not to visit over weekend or long holidays. Night lighting was not so extraordinary, it seems simple for me. If you plan to visit Hawa Mahal, take Metro if possible. I would recommend to visit in morning for inside visit. Outside view is only for photo purposes. If you want to know the history please visit inside the monument, it is more beautiful.",
      "Historic and identity of Jaipur, Hawa Mahal stands welcoming it's visitors, passer-bys and foreign tourists. Reminding the diversity of Indian to-visit places it is a landmark too. In the din of the beating heart of Jaipur, one angle of the golden triangle of Indian tourism, it pleases the exhausted minds.",
      "The architecture and views are quite nice but based on the same I expected it to be a lot more wind centric but it wasn't. Perhaps getting a guide might make it more interesting next time. There are some nice sculptures around on display too\n\nNOTE: It can get quite crowded and hectic so try to find a time that is not going to be very crowded (maybe early)."

      "Everything good about the institute viz via education, teachers, placement etc. but I do want to bring to the notice of the authorities that almost all girls washrooms have a leakage in the wash basins and also hygiene is an issue.  Kindly address the issue as it is difficult to spend 7-8 hours in a college without going to the washroom for a girl student.",

      "After years, revisiting JW Marriott Chandigarh felt like coming home. The warm ambience and impeccable service were just as I remembered. The food was consistently delicious and flavorful, bringing back memories of past visits while still feeling fresh. Saffron restaurant's elegant yet welcoming vibe perfectly blends luxury and comfort, making it a delightful dining experience.",

The live counters were particularly memorable.\n\nThe staff deserves special recognition for their warm hospitality and attentiveness, which made every guest feel valued. JW Marriott continues to set the standard for exceptional dining and service.",
      "Had a great experience at this hotel recently. Stayed with family for 2 nights. Great service and food. The buffet spread for breakfast as well dinner was quite lavish. Special thanks and recognition for chef Amit for his warm hospitality. He customised a few dishes for us. He also made baby food on request.",
      "We went to Saffron,  but I am very sorry to say nothing was there which spoke about Marriott service. We wanted a quite Birthday dinner, but the day the girl who served us was in a hurry to send us out of the restaurant.  Very pathetic state of affair, if the hospitality would have been good, we would not have mind spending 10K on food. I hope they will improve",
      "Food was good. Front staff was not competent or knowledgeable about Marriott stay or reward points. They messed up my reward points. I booked hotel for three nights and my 90 yrs old dad decided to join me for one night.  I booked one additional room on points for the last night that overlapped with my original stay. As both rooms were on my name they gave zero reward points due to the one room that was booked on points. I have tried to resolve for the last 6-7 weeks but I get the same reply back that there is nothing they can do. The front staff was not professional or knowledgeable on the days i stayed and they are behaving the samexway weeks after. I suggest to don't stay there if you don't want to deal with problems and no one to solve",
      "We stayed at the JW Marriott in Chandigarh for a week and the service was excellent. We were warmly welcomed upon arrival and our room was very nice. The hotel itself is well-appointed and thoughtfully decorated. The breakfast was fantastic! Chef Amit took wonderful care of us and made special dishes for us to try. He even packed a little box of banana bread for my husband and we snacked on it during our return home. The entire staff in the breakfast area were phenomenally kind, thoughtful and attentive.\nI took the opportunity to enjoy their spa for a 3-hour treatment with the amazing Biana who is absolutely amazing and works with you to address any pain or soreness you may have. She was a delight!\nThe value for money was very good and the prices in the restaurants we tried was well-prepared, decent portions, and fresh ingredients. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel. Thank you for taking such amazing care of us.",
      "Be prepared to be ripped off, with hiked up pricing for food, meeting space, car for the day (over $250 cdn!)  Atmosphere was nice but not fancy given the crazy pricing I expected better.  Internet was not working, printer in business Center was not working.  Staff are clueless, confused and cannot answer questions.  When asked for a late check out they lie that the hotel is full when there was availability (checked online). Don‚Äôt stay here there are better hotels in the area"

      "It‚Äôs really nice place to visit in between November to February. Staying in tents and enjoying traditional culture is one my best experience ever",
      "The Rann of Kutch is a must-visit, offering breathtaking views of the white salt desert. Its beauty is surreal, especially under the moonlight. During the Rann Utsav, the cultural programs, camel rides, and traditional crafts make the experience even more memorable. Truly unforgettable!",
      "Excellent place to visit. Best time to visit November to March to experience white salt.",
      "It's a very beautiful place, a must visit..but the problem is the mode of transportation. Either you have to take a private cab or need to stay nearby options which are comparatively expensive. If you rent a car also they'll charge around 3000 per day but only in the morning and evening we can go to the desert because of the climate so a full day renting is not a good option..There is no other nearby destination as well to visit ..",
      "A must visit treasure of India üáÆüá≥. The Rann of Kutch is a magical place. It's a photographer's paradise, offering breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset. Nearby cities and attractions are worth visiting too.  The annual Rann Utsav festival transforms this quiet desert into a vibrant cultural hub, showcasing traditional music, dance, and crafts of Gujarat and the Kutch region. It‚Äôs not just a destination but an unforgettable experience.",
      "The **Rann of Kutch** is indeed a fascinating place! It's one of the largest salt deserts in the world, located in the state of Gujarat, India. The area is known for its stunning white landscape, which becomes especially magical during the full moon nights.\n\nOne of the best times to visit is during the **Rann Utsav**, a cultural festival that takes place from November to February. The festival showcases the rich heritage of the region with traditional music, dance, crafts, and local cuisine. Visitors can also enjoy activities like camel rides, hot air ballooning, and exploring the nearby villages.\n\nHave you been to the Rann of Kutch before, or are you planning a visit? üòä",

      "Great place to visit but No proper public facilities such as enough washrooms, no water in washrooms, very unhygienic place, no water at eating joints, full of plastic garbage, zero cleanliness, reputational issue for Gujarat as well as for India specially when we are marketing this at international level. Very disappointing experience. It requires attention please as well as cooperation from the people who visit this place."
